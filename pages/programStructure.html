                <p><b>Description:</b> The Biomedical Imaging Center houses advanced imaging technologies for
                    non-invasive visualization and analysis of biological systems at the cellular and molecular level.
                    Researchers utilize cutting-edge imaging modalities such as confocal microscopy, magnetic resonance
                    imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed
                    tomography (SPECT) to investigate physiological processes, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic
                    interventions.</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b> The Environmental Monitoring Station is equipped with a comprehensive array of
                    sensors and monitoring instruments for real-time environmental data collection and analysis.
                    Researchers use this facility to study air quality, water pollution, soil contamination, and
                    ecological dynamics in diverse ecosystems. The station is equipped
                    with meteorological stations, water quality analyzers, gas chromatographs, and remote sensing
                    technologies.</p>
